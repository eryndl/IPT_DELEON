            <h1>Commission</h1>
            <p>Commissioning an original artwork is a personal and meaningful experience, and an 
                opportunity to own a custom, one-of-a-kind piece of art. I’m pleased to share my 
                passion professionally and accept public and private commissions worldwide.
            </p>

            <h2>Commission Subjects</h2>
            <p>Reasons for commissioning an artwork are many and varied. I work closely 
                with clients to bring their vision to life in a unique, aesthetic, and 
                recognizable style. Commissions focusing on any of the subjects reflected 
                in my repertoire are welcome.

                 are completed with graphite, acrylic, coloured pencil, color pens, and ink. All works are

                    <h3>Consideration of Subject, Size, and Space</h3>
                    <p>Whether you have a particular idea in mind, are seeking something similar to 
                        a past work of mine, or would like a recommendation based on the space 
                        where the artwork will be displayed, think about how you would like the artwork 
                        to look. All ideas and suggestions are welcome.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Submit Your Enquiry</h3>
                    <p>When ready, please complete and submit the enquiry form below, describing your 
                        ideas for the artwork in as much detail as possible and attaching any images 
                        (if appropriate). Once this information is received, I will contact you to start 
                        discussing your commission.

                    <h3>Payment</h3>
                    <p>Following discussion and acceptance of the booking, a deposit of 30% of the commission 
                        price is required to start work. This is to secure the time and initial outlay of 
                        materials and is non-refundable. The balance is due by, or at the 
                        time of completion, and paid prior to shipment.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once the commission order is confirmed, you will receive an email with an invoice for 
                        the deposit from which payment can be made directly by either credit/debit card or 
                        Gcash or PayPal.

                    <h3>Preliminary Sketch</h3>
                    <p>I will prepare a rough pencil sketch based on the details discussed and/or chosen 
                        reference photograph. This will provide an opportunity to make adjustments, refinements, 
                        and to confirm the composition, pose, and placement of all the artwork elements.

                    <h3>Timeframe</h3>
                    <p>Like everything of quality and value, the creation of original art takes time. 
                        Completion times will vary depending on the size, detail, and complexity. Please 
                        keep this in mind and advise if the commission is for a special occasion or required 
                        by a specific date when completing the enquiry form. While all reasonable efforts will 
                        be made, unfortunately not all timeframes are possible, and this will be advised prior 
                        to confirming any booking. You will be kept updated with progress photos, at which point 
                        adjustments can be made only within the scope of possibility.

                    <h3>Completion and Delivery</h3>
                    <p>International shipping is calculated by location. All commissions are shipped
                        by courier and fully insured for the total artwork value. A tracking number 
                        will be provided once your order has been dispatched. A daytime delivery address 
                        is necessary as all items require a signature upon receipt for added protection.
