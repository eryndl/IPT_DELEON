                <p>I am Eryn Rae de Leon, a 20-year-old self-taught artist residing in Malabon City. 
                    I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Information Technology at the City 
                    of Malabon University.
                </p>
                <p>My passion for art began at the tender age of six. As a child, I would draw on 
                    walls and school papers, which eventually grew into a beloved hobby. Initially, 
                    I focused on creating drawings of cartoon and anime characters. When I started 
                    formal schooling, my teachers recognized my artistic talent. By the third grade, 
                    I began participating in poster-making competitions, not only in my school but 
                    also in interschool events and other places.
                </p>
                <p>My elementary years were marked by numerous achievements in various poster-making 
                    competitions. This continued into high school, where I further honed my skills 
                    and explored different art styles. During this time, I also joined the school’s 
                    journalism team as an editorial cartoonist. This role allowed me to showcase my 
                    talent and brought me the honor of competing at the Regional Schools Press 
                    Conference (RSPC).
                </p>
                <p>Now in college, I continue to pursue my passion for art alongside my studies. During my 
                    free time, I still draw and create art, keeping the spark of creativity alive. 
                </p>
                <h3>⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯</h3>
                <h2>What I do!</h2>
                <p>My work includes sketching and portrait art, where I focus on capturing details 
                    and expressions with precision. I enjoy working with various mediums such as color 
                    pencils, oil pastels, and pens, which allow me to create vibrant, textured, and 
                    detailed artworks that stand out.
                </p>    

                <p>In addition to these, I also have skills in acrylic painting, where I explore 
                    colorful, and creative abstract art or specifically minimalist abstract art. 
                    I also do face painting, combining creativity and attention to detail to produce 
                    unique and fun designs that bring joy to others.
                </p>    
                    
                <p>Art for me is a way of expressing emotions, telling stories, and sharing ideas. 
                    Each piece I create is an opportunity to bring a vision to life and connect 
                    with people through creativity.

                <h2>Educational Background</h2>
                <p>My educational journey reflects a strong commitment to personal growth and academic 
                    development, rooted in Malabon City. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science 
                    in Information Technology (BSIT) at the City of Malabon University, where I have been 
                    enrolled since 2022.
                </p>     
                <p>Before this, I completed my Senior High School education at Arellano 
                    University Jose Rizal High School from 2020 to 2022, specializing in Humanities and 
                    Social Sciences (HUMSS).                  
                </p>
                <p>My secondary education at Concepcion Technical Vocational School from 2016 to 2020 further 
                    refined my creative skills.
                </p>    
                <p>While my early years at Concepcion Elementary School from 2011 to 2016, 
                    laid the foundation for my passion for the arts. Each stage of my academic journey has been a 
                    stepping stone in crafting my identity as an artist, blending technical skills with the 
                    boundless power of imagination.
